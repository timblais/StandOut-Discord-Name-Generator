# StandOut-Discord-Name-Generator

This is a basic name generator app that randomly generates a username from a random adjective paired with a random noun. Initial basic functionality allows you to generate the name, link out to webster's dictionary for definitions of the words, and lock either the adjective or noun in place for subsequent generations.

Uses the https://github.com/dulldesk/words-api/ random word api.
